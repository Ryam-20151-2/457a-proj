# 457a-proj

A repo for the ECE 457a project
Hello Professor,

This is our final project, to test it out run the main!
We did not setup any command line functinality, however with default settings it will use each implementation to run a crawl with a random start location!
It pulls data from ex.csv which is a data set we created ourselves!

Please let us know if you have any questions,
